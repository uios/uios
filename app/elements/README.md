### Card Activation

Souls that are Played face-down are not considered active. Active cards are face-up Souls. Souls are activated when they are flipped over to face-up from face-down position and when they are Played In-Hand to the <mark>Combat Region</mark>. You may activate any number of cards in the Combat Region, but you may only activate one Soul In-Hand per sequence.

> **Combat Region** - The zone on the game field where cards are played.

### TriCode

![Battle Field](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thebanon/dreamers/master/app/r8vsb6.png)

There are special laws when calculating damages in Combat. Red overpowers Green overpowers Blue overpowers Red. When calculating damages these laws govern the <mark>Power</mark> of Souls. The Power of the Soul overpowered by the TriCode is halved. Thus, a Blue Soul wins the Round of a Power 8 Red Soul VS a Power 6 Blue Soul.

> **Power** - The number on a Soul.
